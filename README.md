# digital_music_sales
Repository for group project analyzing the impact of digital music sales on various industries.

### Project Proposal
As consumer music consumption has shifted from discs to digital, what other industries have had to adapt to support this consumer trend?  Conversley, what industries have suffered as a result?   This data will be prepared, combined, structured and organized by a team of ill-equipped data analysts who will assess for trends and correlations, then demonstrate the findings visually.
