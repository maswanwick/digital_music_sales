# digital_music_sales
Repository for group project analyzing the impact of digital music sales on various industries.

### Project Proposal
As consumer music consumption has shifted from discs to digital, what other industries have had to adapt to support this consumer trend?  Conversley, what industries have suffered as a result?   This data will be prepared, combined, structured and organized by a team of ill-equipped data analysts who will assess for trends and correlations, then demonstrate the findings visually.

#### Repository Layout
This repository is organized in the following manner
| Item | Description |
|-|-|
| `analysis/` | All source code used to build the final deliverable.  This  is where the polished product will go.|
| `presentation/` | All files used in the building of the presentation.  Images, slides, notes, etc. |
| `research/` | Files, code snippets, CSVs, etc. used in preparing the analysis.  Think of this as the sandbox/holding tank for experimental code or research that didn't pan out. |
| `.gitignore` | Use this to keep items from being committed to github.|
| `README.md` | This file.|

All folders currently have a `placeholder.txt` in them in order to build out the folder structure.  These will be/can be removed once real content is present.
