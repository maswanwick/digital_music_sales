  Apple products made digital music more accessible. Apple stopped adding a CD slot in their laptops in 2012.
  I chose to only look at Apple instead of all tech companies. I think if I looked at Microsoft the data would be similar.

  I find this interesting because AM/FM radio is free, as long as you have a device that can use it. My thoughts are paying
    for music allows for no or fewer ads as well as more music to listen to on demand. A note to make, radio also has more
    content than just music, like sports or news. So it might be that the decline in radio listeners is only in music.
